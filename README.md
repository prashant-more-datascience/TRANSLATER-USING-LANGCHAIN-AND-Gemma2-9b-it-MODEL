How It Works
Input Fields:
Enter the text you want to translate in the "Text to Translate" field.
Specify the target language in the "Target Language" field (e.g., French, Spanish, German).

AI-Powered Translation:
The app uses a LangChain pipeline that combines:
A prompt template for setting the translation context.
The ChatGroq model for processing the translation request.
An output parser to extract and display the translated text.


Output:
Click the "Translate" button to submit your inputs.
The app processes your request and displays the translated text instantly.
